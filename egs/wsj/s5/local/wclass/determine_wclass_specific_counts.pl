Usage:  determine_wclass_specific_counts.pl [options] <wclass-name> <wclass-label> <wclass-list> <all-wclass-count> <one-wclass-count>

This script takes a file with the replacement counts of entries for all word
classes and extracts the counts for a specific word class.

In case the probability-like value of the word class for OOV detection is more
than 0.0 (read from <wclass-list>), this script adds a count for a special
sub-word unit (SWU) symbol. That special SWU can later be replaced by an SWU
graph for OOV detection.

Allowed options:
  --replace-blanks-with-dash   : Replace blanks in word class entry with "-"   (boolean, default = false)
