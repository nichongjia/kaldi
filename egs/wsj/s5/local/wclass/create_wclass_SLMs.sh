# This script creates sub-languages models for all word classes which are
# listed in the file $wclass_list (e.g. data/local/wclass/wclass_list.txt).
#
# Apart from the word class list file the script also expects to find files
# which include
# word class label, a (corpus-dependent) count, word class entry, e.g.
# C=WEEKDAY 6588 MONDAY
# C=WEEKDAY 5662 TUESDAY
# C=WEEKDAY 4794 WEDNESDAY
# ...
# These files can for example be created using the SRI LM tool
# replace-words-with-classes (see also replace_wclass_entries_with_labels.sh).
#
# If the file $wclass_list indicates that SWUs should be used for OOV
# detection (find more details in the comments below), this script embeds
# an OOV sub-language model into the word-class sub-language model.
#
# The approach is also described in the paper "How to Add Word Classes
# to the Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit" (TSD 2016)
