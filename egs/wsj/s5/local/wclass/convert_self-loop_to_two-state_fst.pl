#
# This script converts a unigram with self-loops to a unigram with separate
# states. As a result, it is not possible to go through the graph producing
# only empty words (<eps>).
#
# If the option --back-transition <disambig-symbol> is used, a back transition
# is added to the FST which allows to go through the graph one ore more times.
# This is useful if the terminal symbols are e.g. sub-word units (SWUs) which
# are used to detect/cover out-of-vocabulary words (OOVs).
